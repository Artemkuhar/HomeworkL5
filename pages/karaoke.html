			I used to think that I could not go on <br>
			And life was nothing but an awful song <br>
			But now I know the meaning of true love <br>
			I'm leaning on the everlasting arms <br>
			If I can see it, then I can do it <br>
			If I just believe it, there's nothing to it <br>
			I believe I can fly <br>
			I believe I can touch the sky <br>
			I think about it every night and day (Night and day) <br>
			Spread my wings and fly away <br>
			I believe I can soar <br>
			I see me running through that open door <br>
			I believe I can fly <br>
			I believe I can fly <br>
			I believe I can fly hoo <br>
			See I was on the verge of breaking down <br>
			Sometimes silence can seem so loud <br>
			There are miracles in life I must achieve <br>
			But first I know it starts inside of me, ho oh <br>
			If I can see it hoo, then I can be it <br>
			If I just believe it, there's nothing to it <br>
			I believe I can fly <br>
			I believeâ€¦
